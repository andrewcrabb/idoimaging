## I Do Imaging

I Do Imaging is the place to find free and open source medical imaging software.  Here you'll find nearly 300 software projects, categorized, ranked, and searchable.  We're constantly adding new applications, updating existing ones, listing version updates, and removing defunct projects.  

This is version 2 of the site.  After 15 years, the old site has been completely rewritten in Rails (read about the rewrite in the [blog post](http://blog.idoimaging.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/18/the-i-do-imaging-technology-stack-2017.html)).  Not all functionality and features are yet present, but all new content is added to this site, which is also much faster than before.
