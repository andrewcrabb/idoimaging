## About I Do Imaging

**I Do Imaging** is a searchable database of free and open source medical imaging software.  Imaging projects are located, categorised and tracked for version releases and site address changes.  Test data is available for most programs, and technical notes on building and installing some of the programs are stored in the wiki.

I Do Imaging is written and developed by Andrew Crabb.  It began as a personal project in 2002, in response to the static and frequently outdated 'list of links' seen on many imaging websites.
