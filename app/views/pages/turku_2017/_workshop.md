#### A practical workshop series for people working with medical image data.

In this series of three, three-hour workshops, we will be learning techniques to address common data processing needs in medical imaging, with particular emphasis on PET research imaging using free software.  We’ll learn how to use software to reduce manual work so we can concentrate on the actual science.

In each session we’ll use readily-available free software and use it on supplied example data. We will concentrate on improving efficiency and accuracy by using good practices and frequently-used techniques that can be applied to any image processing workflow

New this year: Pre-configured Windows machines will be available that contain all the workshop's software and data, pre-installed and ready to run. You'll access these remotely using Microsoft Remote Desktop which is available for Windows or Mac.  If you're comfortable with installing a variety of software, you can install everything on your own laptop.

**Day One**: The first session will focus on viewing and understanding the two parts of medical image files: the image data, and the metadata, or image header, that contains information about the patient, the scan, and the image data itself.

**Day Two**: The second session will involve modifying images: editing the header, anonymisation, and converting the image to another format.  We’ll also set up a PACS node on our computers to receive images from a hospital network.

**Day Three**: In the final session we’ll look at tools to automate the processing of large numbers of images.  We will also set up a PACS server that can be used to store and distribute images within your workgroup. 

Learn these skills and you’ll be the hero of your lab!
